Attack on Titan Game

Overview

Attack on Titan Game is a lane-based 2D single-player game inspired by the popular anime Attack on Titan. This project was created during my 2nd semester in Spring 2024 as part of my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. It was my first-ever game development project.

I took the time to revamp the frontend to enhance the visual experience, while the backend remains the same as in the original version.
